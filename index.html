		<strong>M</strong>y name is Cavlin Mondele, US. Citizen, in 2012, I graduated my college in fine art at Montgomery College in Maryland State. I can say that I am a fne art artist. But since fews years, I started loving the computer science and I enrolled in Cyber Secuty major at ECPI University for bachelor degree. 
	</p>
	<p class="inline">
		<strong>I</strong> went to fine art class because I wanted to work for myself and be my own boss. But right now the technology leading the World in every life aspect. So
		I am also a creative person.To me I tought that learning to code will be the best for me as a career. Because I tried to work to some companies, but it was very stressful. 
	</p>
	<p class="inline">
		<strong>S</strong>o I thing my decision of learning to code will be the best of my life. Because with coding I can retire early and enjoying my life with my family. I don't want to work hard but I want to work smart and make my life easier than it was before.
